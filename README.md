This repository demonstrates a common mistake in Dockerfiles: using `ubuntu:latest` and inefficient file copying. The original Dockerfile exhibits this issue, while the fixed version shows how to use a specific version tag and improve the COPY process for a smaller and more efficient image. This is important for consistent builds and better performance.
